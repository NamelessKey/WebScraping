  "Bio": "Coming to life as a chunk of stone, Tiny's origins are a mystery on which he continually speculates.  He is a Stone Giant now, but what did he used to be?  A splinter broken from a Golem's heel?  A shard swept from a gargoyle-sculptor's workshop?  A fragment of the Oracular Visage of Garthos?  A deep curiosity drives him, and he travels the world tirelessly seeking his origins, his parentage, his people.  As he roams, he gathers weight and size; the forces that weather lesser rocks, instead cause Tiny to grow and ever grow.",
